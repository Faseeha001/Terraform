 # Terraform #
## Overview ##
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

## Features ##
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform enables the definition of infrastructure as code, allowing you to manage and provision infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage in a declarative manner.

**Multi-Cloud Support**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and more. It also supports various infrastructure providers like VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes.

**State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the resources it manages. This state file allows Terraform to understand the current state of the infrastructure and make changes incrementally.

**Plan and Apply Workflow:** Terraform follows a "plan and apply" workflow where it generates an execution plan based on the desired state declared in configuration files. Users can review the plan before applying changes to the infrastructure.

**Modules**: Terraform allows you to organize your configuration into reusable modules, which can be shared across different projects or teams. This promotes consistency and reduces duplication of code.

**Community Ecosystem**: Terraform has a vibrant community that contributes modules, plugins, and best practices, making it easier to adopt and extend.

## Getting Started ##
Terraform Installation on LINUX.md

Management: Use terraform commands like terraform show, terraform state, and terraform destroy to manage your infrastructure over time.
