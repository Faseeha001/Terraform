          # Terraform #

          Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
          It allows you to define, manage, and provision infrastructure resources in a cloud or on-premises environment using declarative configuration files.
          Terraform maintains the state of the infrastructure in a state file.
